# interview_test_project

*First of all, it's awesome that you are reading this introduction because that means, that you had your first successful
interview. As a next step, we need will check your Flutter skills, your knowledge and how you solve problems.*



## Introduction

In this project you will find designs from our app [Storyways](https://storyways.app), you can fork this repository, or create a new public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) where you implement the screens shown in the designs.


## Task

The design shows a list of books with a searchbar at the top. When you start searching the overlay expands and shows the results. The data is mocked for now and you can use [picsum](https://picsum.photos/) for finding example photos for book covers.
